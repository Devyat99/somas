The guides in this section explain how to manage your Puli_ repository.  Your
Puli repository should be set up already. If it's not, read
:doc:`getting-started` to do it now.

If you don't know what Puli is or why you should use it, read :doc:`at-a-glance`
first.

Depending on how you created your repository, there are different guides that
explain how to manage the repository:

* :doc:`repository-management/composer` explains how to manage the repository
  generated by the `Composer plugin`_.

* :doc:`repository-management/manual` explains how to manage a resource
  repository manually.
