We have several guides that show how to get started quickly with Puli_. If you
don't know what Puli is, read :doc:`at-a-glance` first.

The right guide depends on what you develop:

* :doc:`getting-started/application-devs` explains how to use Puli in
  applications that use Composer_ to load their required packages.

* :doc:`getting-started/package-devs` explains how to use Puli in reusable
  Composer_ packages, sometimes also called "libraries".

If you are not sure, start with :doc:`getting-started/application-devs`.
