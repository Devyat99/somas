Getting Started
===============

We have several guides that show you how to get started quickly with Puli_. If
you don't know what Puli is, read :doc:`at-a-glance` first.

The guides focus on your actual use case of Puli. If you are not sure what to
read, start with :doc:`getting-started/puli-and-composer-application`.
