The Puli Components
===================

Puli consists of four core components:

   :alt: A figure of the four core components.

A summary of each component is given below.

The PHP API
-----------

The `Puli`_ package contains a PHP API for managing *resource repositories* that
map *Puli paths* to physical paths on the file system:

.. code-block:: php

    use Puli\Repository\ResourceRepository;

    $repo = new ResourceRepository();
    $repo->add('/app', '/path/to/project/res');

    echo $repo->get('/app/views/index.html')->getContents();

:doc:`repositories` explains in detail how to create resource repositories
by hand.

The Repository Manager
----------------------

The `Puli Repository Manager`_ manages a resource repository using puli.json
files in the root directory of your project and any installed packages:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "resources": {
            "/app": "res"
        }
    }

In :doc:`mapping-resources` you will learn all about mapping resources
in puli.json files.

The Command Line Interface
--------------------------

The `Puli CLI`_ is a command line interface to the repository manager. The most
important command is ``puli dump``, which generates the managed resource
repository as a PHP file:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ puli dump

The generated file can be loaded in your PHP code:

.. code-block:: php

    $repo = require __DIR__.'/.puli/resource-repository.php';

    echo $repo->get('/app/views/index.html')->getContents();

The Composer Plugin
-------------------

The `Composer Plugin`_ for Puli integrates Composer into the repository manager.
With this plugin, the puli.json files of all installed Composer packages are
loaded automatically. For example, if the Composer package "acme/blog" maps
resources to the Puli path ``/acme/blog``, you can access these resources like
so:

    .. code-block:: php

        echo $repo->get('/acme/blog/views/post.html')->getContents();
