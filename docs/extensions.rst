Puli_ features various extensions that integrate the library with other tools
and libraries. If you haven't got a working Puli repository yet, read
:doc:`getting-started`.

If you don't know what Puli is or why you should use it, read :doc:`at-a-glance`
first.

The following table points you to the documentation of the individual extensions:
